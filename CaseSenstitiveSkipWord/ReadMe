In this Exercise, we have included DistributedCache class to import a file containing words to be skipped while
calculating their word count. Also counters are used to report corresponding type of words through the use of
ENUM.

There is two files.one is "UN.Txt" which is containing the words and other file is skipfile which is having the word 
that need to be skipped



If you do want upper and lowercase letters to be counted separately, do not type “-case” in
command line. Similarly do not include “-skip” and corresponding file path if you do not want
words to be skipped.
